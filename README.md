# Not maintained anymore

Project has been moved to [jakubito/spotify-release-list](https://github.com/jakubito/spotify-release-list)

My idea for Spotify Release List began as an extension for Google Chrome. After some time I decided to create hosted version which works on all devices and browsers, including phones. Having to support two separate projects doing the same thing was not an option for me. That's why I decided to move all my effort into the hosted version.

# Spotify Release List

Display list of Spotify releases from artists you follow.

This extension is available on [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-release-list/nnlbnohmlacgaefjagionbiopljfgolk).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn build` to build the extension
